## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Backend code updated (logo_url, game sorting)
- [x] Dashboard code updated (logo display, sorting)
- [ ] **TODO:** Restart backend to load changes
- [ ] **TODO:** Test with live NFL games tomorrow
- [ ] **TODO:** Monitor first celebration to verify timing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Before NFL Games Start:**
   - Restart backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
   - Verify dashboard loads at http://localhost:5173
   - Check that NFL games appear in dashboard

2. **During Games:**
   - Monitor a team with expected score changes
   - Verify lights celebrate on touchdowns (12s) and field goals (5s)
   - Check dashboard updates within ~7 seconds of ESPN API
   - Expect 1-3 minute delay between actual play and celebration

3. **If Issues Occur:**
   - Check logs: `logs/smart_stadium.log`
   - Verify WiZ lights connectivity: Run `test_lights.py`
   - Test ESPN API: Run `test_nfl_readiness.py`
   - Check WebSocket: Open browser dev console on dashboard
