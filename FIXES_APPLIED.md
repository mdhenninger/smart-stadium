# Frontend/Backend Communication Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 3, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical WebSocket connection and data serialization issues preventing real-time communication between frontend and backend.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed WebSocket Connection Persistence (`app/main.py`)

**Problem:** WebSocket connections were closing immediately after opening because the endpoint was waiting for client messages that never came.

**Solution:**
- Added `asyncio` import
- Modified WebSocket endpoint to send periodic ping messages (every 30 seconds)
- Uses `asyncio.wait_for()` with timeout instead of blocking on `receive_text()`
- Added proper exception handling and logging for WebSocket errors

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before: Connection closed immediately
while True:
    await websocket.receive_text()  # Blocks forever waiting for messages

# After: Keeps connection alive with pings
while True:
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(websocket.receive_text(), timeout=30.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        await websocket.send_json({"type": "ping"})
```

---

### 2. ✅ Enhanced WebSocket Manager (`app/websocket/manager.py`)

**Problem:** No visibility into WebSocket connection status or broadcast failures.

**Solution:**
- Added logging for connections, disconnections, and broadcasts
- Added connection counting
- Better error handling with detailed logging
- Logs successful vs failed broadcasts

**Key Improvements:**
- `connect()`: Logs total active connections
- `disconnect()`: Logs remaining connections
- `broadcast()`: Logs success rate and failures

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed GameSnapshot Serialization (`app/models/game.py`)

**Problem:** The `game_id` field with alias `"id"` was not serializing correctly for frontend consumption.

**Solution:**
- Added `by_alias = True` to model Config
- Overrode `model_dump()` method to default to `by_alias=True` and `mode='json'`
- Ensures datetime objects serialize to ISO strings
- Guarantees nested objects (TeamScore, RedZoneInfo) serialize correctly

**Code Changes:**
```python
class GameSnapshot(BaseModel):
    game_id: str = Field(..., alias="id")
    # ... other fields ...
    
    class Config:
        populate_by_name = True
        by_alias = True  # NEW
    
    def model_dump(self, **kwargs):  # NEW
        kwargs.setdefault('by_alias', True)
        kwargs.setdefault('mode', 'json')
        return super().model_dump(**kwargs)
```

---

### 4. ✅ Updated Games Endpoint (`app/api/routes/games.py`)

**Problem:** Explicit `by_alias=True` call was redundant and potentially confusing.

**Solution:**
- Simplified to `game.model_dump()` since model now defaults to proper serialization
- Added comment explaining the default behavior

---

### 5. ✅ Improved Frontend WebSocket Error Handling (`dashboard/src/hooks/useLiveEvents.ts`)

**Problem:** No visibility into WebSocket connection lifecycle or message receipt.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive console logging for all WebSocket events:
  - Connection attempts
  - Successful connections
  - Message receipts (with event type)
  - Ping messages (filtered from event stream)
  - Errors with details
  - Disconnections with close codes
- Filters out ping messages from event stream
- Better error context for debugging

**Logging Added:**
- `[WebSocket] Connecting to: <url>`
- `[WebSocket] Connected successfully`
- `[WebSocket] Received event: <type>`
- `[WebSocket] Received ping`
- `[WebSocket] Error: <details>`
- `[WebSocket] Closed: <code> <reason>`

---

## Expected Results

### Backend (Terminal 1)
You should now see:
```
INFO:app.websocket.manager:WebSocket connected. Total connections: 1
INFO:app.websocket.manager:Broadcast message to 1/1 connections
```

### Frontend (Terminal 2 / Browser Console)
You should now see:
```
[WebSocket] Connecting to: ws://localhost:5173/api/ws
[WebSocket] Connected successfully
[WebSocket] Received ping
[WebSocket] Received event: celebration
[WebSocket] Received event: victory
```

### UI Changes
1. **Status Bar**: Connection status should show "Live updates" (green)
2. **Live Feed**: Should populate with celebration events as they occur
3. **Games Panel**: Game data should display correctly with proper scores
4. **Real-time**: Celebrations trigger live updates in the feed

---

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Mark\Documents\Python_Projects\smart-stadium
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python -m uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Mark\Documents\Python_Projects\smart-stadium\dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console tab
   - Look for `[WebSocket]` log messages

4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Status bar shows "Live updates"
   - ✅ Console shows successful WebSocket connection
   - ✅ Backend logs show "WebSocket connected. Total connections: 1"
   - ✅ When a score changes, see "Broadcast message" in backend
   - ✅ See celebration events in frontend console and Live Feed panel

5. **Trigger Test Celebration:**
   - Use the "Manual celebrations" panel
   - Fill in team info and click "Launch celebration"
   - Should appear in Live Feed immediately

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Flow (Fixed)
```
Frontend                  Backend
   |                         |
   |-------- connect ------->|
   |<------- accept ---------|
   |                         |
   |<------- ping ----------|  (every 30s)
   |                         |
   |<--- celebration msg ---|  (on score)
   |                         |
```

### Data Serialization Flow (Fixed)
```
GameSnapshot (Python)
    ↓ model_dump() with by_alias=True, mode='json'
    ↓ game_id → "id"
    ↓ datetime → ISO string
    ↓ nested objects serialized
JSON Response
    ↓ HTTP Response
Frontend TypeScript Interface
    ✅ All fields match expected types
```

## Files Modified

1. `app/main.py` - WebSocket endpoint with ping/pong
2. `app/websocket/manager.py` - Enhanced logging and error handling
3. `app/models/game.py` - Fixed serialization with proper aliases
4. `app/api/routes/games.py` - Simplified endpoint code
5. `dashboard/src/hooks/useLiveEvents.ts` - Added comprehensive logging

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Optimize Polling**: Panels could listen to WebSocket events instead of polling every 45s
2. **Add Reconnection UI**: Show reconnection attempts to user
3. **Add WebSocket Health Check**: Periodic pong response from frontend
4. **Add Message Queue**: Buffer messages during reconnection
5. **Add WebSocket Authentication**: If needed for security

---

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, you can rollback using Git:
```bash
git diff HEAD  # Review changes
git checkout -- app/main.py app/websocket/manager.py app/models/game.py
git checkout -- app/api/routes/games.py
git checkout -- dashboard/src/hooks/useLiveEvents.ts
```

---

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for `[WebSocket]` messages
2. Check backend logs for `WebSocket connected` messages
3. Verify both servers are running on correct ports
4. Check firewall/antivirus not blocking WebSocket connections
5. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) in browser
