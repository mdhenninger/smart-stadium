### Testing the Dashboard

#### Prerequisites
1. **Development Server**: `npm run dev` (already running on http://localhost:3000/)
2. **Backend API**: Should be running on backend port for full functionality
3. **Network Devices**: WiZ lights on the same network for device testing

#### Navigation Testing
1. **Home Page**: Start at root `/` - shows sport selection
2. **Game Selection**: Click on NFL ‚Üí navigate to `/games`
3. **Live Dashboard**: Select a game ‚Üí navigate to `/dashboard/{gameId}`
4. **Settings**: Access via navigation ‚Üí `/settings`
5. **Help**: Access via navigation ‚Üí `/help`
