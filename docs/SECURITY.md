## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Smart Stadium team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Smart Stadium, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send email to: [SECURITY_EMAIL] (replace with actual email)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** within 48 hours
2. **Confirm the vulnerability** and determine affected versions
3. **Release fixes** as soon as possible
4. **Notify you** when the vulnerability is fixed
5. **Credit you** in our security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
   - Update Node.js dependencies: `npm audit fix`
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies

2. **Network Security**
   - Ensure WiZ lights and server are on a secure network
   - Use strong WiFi passwords and WPA3 encryption
   - Consider isolating IoT devices on a separate network segment

3. **API Security**
   - Change default API endpoints if deploying publicly
   - Use HTTPS in production deployments
   - Implement rate limiting for public APIs
   - Validate all input data

4. **Configuration Security**
   - Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
   - Don't commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique passwords for any authentication

5. **Device Security**
   - Keep WiZ lights firmware updated
   - Change default device passwords if applicable
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual activity

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive data
   - Use security linting tools (bandit for Python, ESLint security rules)

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly audit dependencies with `npm audit` and `pip-audit`
   - Pin dependency versions to avoid supply chain attacks
   - Review dependencies before adding them to the project

3. **API Security**
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Use HTTPS for all production communications
   - Validate WebSocket origins
   - Implement rate limiting and request throttling

4. **Data Protection**
   - Don't log sensitive information
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure random number generation

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **Local Network Dependency**
   - The system requires local network access to control lights
   - This limits remote attack vectors but requires network security

2. **ESPN API Integration**
   - Uses public ESPN APIs (no authentication required)
   - No sensitive data transmitted to external services

3. **WebSocket Communications**
   - Uses unencrypted WebSocket connections for local development
   - Should be upgraded to WSS (WebSocket Secure) for production

4. **Device Discovery**
   - Uses UDP broadcast for automatic light discovery
   - Limited to local network segment

### Planned Security Enhancements

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement user authentication for web dashboard
   - Role-based access control for different user types
   - API key management for third-party integrations

2. **Encryption**
   - HTTPS/WSS for all production communications
   - Encrypted configuration storage
   - Secure device communication protocols

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Security event logging
   - Intrusion detection capabilities
   - Audit trails for all system actions
